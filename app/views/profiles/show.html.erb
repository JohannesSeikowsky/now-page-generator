<div class="explain_now" id="whatev">
  A Nowpage is a public declaration of priorities. It is where you state to yourself and to others what you are focusing on now. The nowpage movement has been started by Derek Sivers. Many people have begun to add nowpages to their own websites. Many find it an uplifting and valuable thing to do. They say it helps them focus.

    These are the most important things I currently focus on:
    Places - My girlfriend and I are trying an experiment of living in different, interesting places for a couple of months each. Enough to properly internalize each place. Right now we are in Tel Aviv for 3 months and it's going well. 2) Programming- I hack. This site is my latest project. I've done a few others and have a long pipeline of ideas ahead of me. I'm also learning more about penetration testing, as part of which I'm expanding from Ruby to Python. I write. I try not to, but somehow always end up producing something sometimes. By now there are almost 20 blog posts by me. You can find them on medium.<br> <%= link_to "Edit this layout.", "#" %>

    I'm interested in programming, writing, research and teaching. Please feel free to get in touch about collaborating on any project concerned with these interests.
