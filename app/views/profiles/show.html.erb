  <h1> What Iâ€™m doing now </h1>
  <h3> Johannes R. Seikowsky </h3>
  <p>
    These are the most important things I currently focus on: <br>
    <strong>1) Places</strong> - My girlfriend and I are trying an experiment of living in different, interesting places for a couple of months each. Enough to properly internalize each place. Right now we are in Tel Aviv for 3 months.<br>
    <strong>2) Programming</strong> - I hack. This site is my latest project example. I've done some others and have a long pipeline of ideas to work on. I'm also learning more about penetration testing, as part of which Im expanding my Ruby to Python.<br>
    <strong>3) Writing </strong>- I write. I try not to, but somehow always end up producing something sometimes. By now there are almost 20 blog posts by me. You can find them on medium.<br>
    <strong>4) Teaching</strong> - teaching is my day job. I do not consider it my primary career, but I nevertheless like it and think it an honourable profession.<br>

    I'm interested in programming, writing, research and teaching. Please feel free to get in touch about collaborating on any project concerned with these interests.
